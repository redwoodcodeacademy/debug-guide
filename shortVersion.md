# Debug Guide

### Open a Ticket

Ask yourself these questions, and prepare an answer for each of them before asking for help.

* What is my code doing? 
* What should it do?
* How do I know it doesnâ€™t work? (Does it show an error message, or is it not working the way you want it to?)
* What have I tried to fix it, and why?
* What ***data types*** does my function take in, and what should it return?

### Think about these things anytime you see an error

* Use `console.log` to triangulate where your code breaks
* Are you dealing with a ***syntax error***? Does the code say `TypeError` or `undefined does not have a property length`?
    * Check for spelling of your variables
    * Are all your variables declared somewhere?
    * Are you treating your variables as the ***correct data type***?
* Is it a ***logic error***? Is your code actually doing what you think it is doing?
    * Write out an ***environment diagram*** (where you list out all your variables and what they are at each step)
* Refactor code into smaller helper functions so you can test smaller parts of your large code block
* Comment out code and bring your code back to a working status, then slowly add back your code you commented till it breaks (***triangulate errors***)

### Ask for help, we do not get tired of questions, even if we end up telling you to search your question online
* We will show you the answer often, especially in the beginning and with syntax questions
* However, expect that if we point you to a tool (i.e. a built-in function you should check out), you will have to do some ***research yourself*** on Google
* If you still do not understand how to solve the problem, we will help further

No one is any less a student or a person for being frustrated and stuck with documentation, this is common throughout a developer's career.

We ask for everyone to research their questions first not because we do not want to help, but because it will make you good at solving the basic problems of programming:

* ***Syntax***. Spelling and using the right format for your code.
* ***Configuration problems***. Example: setting up a React project (usually people have solutions out there for you already).

What we will most want to help on, and what you will most want our help on, are ***logic problems***. These do not always give an error, and that is why these are the most challenging for all programmers.

## Big Note for Beginners

Have a belief about all of your variables. You should know (write it down if you're unsure) what your variables are most of the time.

***Data type*** is essential, you should never have to guess what data type your variables are. 

You can confirm the data type by using `console.log` or using a function with the variable without erroring.

| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write out your beliefs about your code (what you think your variables look like) |
| Triangulate your bug, test each belief and assumption you have about your code |
| If you coded a lot without testing your code, and now you are lost at where to even start looking for your bug, start by removing code one line/block at a time until you get back to a working code block, then start adding in code one line/group at a time. When you reach your error again, you will have found the suspect. |
| You may also want to clean up your code by refactoring it into smaller functions and then testing the smaller functions. |
| Reproduce your error after you fixed it, did it come back again? This teaches you a lot about the nature of your bug, and general programming beliefs you've held that may be wrong. |
| Build small, test often. Use helper functions where you can. |
| If you feel you are too far gone, you can always start over, this time with more modular code. |
| Understand the question prompt, read it aloud and stop where it doesn't make sense. |
| Read your error codes, does it point you to a place in your file? After looking through all of them is there any part of it that makes sense? (recognizable files) |
